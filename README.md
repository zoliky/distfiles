## About

This repository contains files required by some of the [FreeBSD ports I maintain](https://www.freshports.org/search.php?stype=maintainer&method=exact&query=ports%40zoltankiraly.com). When fetched directly from the original servers, these files often contain dynamic elements, such as timestamps, that vary with each download. These variations prevent the FreeBSD Ports system from passing the integrity check. By hosting the files here on GitHub, I ensure they remain unchanged, allowing the Ports system to fetch and verify them correctly.
